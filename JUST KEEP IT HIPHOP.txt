50 Years of Hip-Hop: The Evolution
Overview
50 Years of Hip-Hop: The Evolution is an interactive, digital archive designed to preserve and visualize the history, growth, and global expansion of Hip-Hop culture. Ranging from its genesis in the Bronx in 1973 to its current status as a global phenomenon, this project serves as a "Living Record Deep Dive."
It is designed not just as a timeline, but as an educational tool that connects the dots between regional sounds, technological disruptions, and international movements.
Project Vision
This archive is a contribution to Hip-Hop culture by Venomous2000 (aka Dwayne L. Sheppard). It is branded under the Global Village Initiative (GVI) and V2G Multimedia, representing a commitment to documenting the culture as accurately and humanly as possible.
"This is an ongoing, updated archive... preserving the history as much as humanly possible."
